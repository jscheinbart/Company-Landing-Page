          <img src="beethoven.jpeg">
          <p>Beethoven remains one of the most admired composers in the history of Western music; his works rank amongst the most performed of the classical music repertoire. His works span the transition from the classical period to the romantic era in classical music.</p>

          <h3>Gustav Mahler</h3>
          <img src="mahler.jpeg">
          <p>While in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question, his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect, which included a ban on its performance in much of Europe during the Nazi era.</p>

          <h3>Hildegard Von Bingen</h3>
          <img src="hildegard.jpeg">
          <p>She is one of the best-known composers of sacred monophony, as well as the most-recorded in modern history. She has been considered by many in Europe to be the founder of scientific natural history in Germany.</p>
